title: The 22th 3D Print &amp; Pizza evening @ Pixelbar Rotterdam
---

**The June edition was suppose to take place at Bitlair in Amersfoort, but because Bitlair is moving and rebuilding the space the June edition will take place at Pixelbar in Rotterdam.**  

At the print & Pizza evening everyone is welcome with an interest in 3D Printing. Are you an advanced DIY-builder, owner of a print farm, or just orientating before buying your first printer? Everyone is welcome at the Print & Pizza evening hosted at Pixelbar in Rotterdam.  

Take your prints or even printer with you to show it to others, to ask questions or get help with problems. Together with the whole group you get tips, maybe someone can help you solve the problem and you get to know others with the same interest.

And of course there will be pizza. You pay for the pizza by Tikkie.

**Location**  
3D Print and Pizza Rotterdam is hosted at Hackerspace Pixelbar. We are at Schiehaven 15C, 3024 EC Rotterdam.

_Note: It is Schiehaven 15C, not Schiehavenweg. Also some mapping options will show 15C as further down the road than it actually is. Google and Apple maps are correct._

If you're coming with public transportation: you can go to Tram stop Schiemond or Metro Station Delfshaven and then walk towards the harbor. We are behind the lit up building "De Kroon", the Schiehaven street itself is quite dark at the moment.

To access the space you need to go up a set stairs, we sadly don‚Äôt have an elevator.
