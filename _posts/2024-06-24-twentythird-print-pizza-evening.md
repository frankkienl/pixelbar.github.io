title: The 23th 3D Print &amp; Pizza evening @ Pixelbar Rotterdam
---

**New location! The next 3D Print &amp; Pizza evening will be held at a new location. Check the info section for more.**

At the print & Pizza evening everyone is welcome with an interest in 3D Printing. Are you an advanced DIY-builder, owner of a print farm, or just orientating before buying your first printer? Everyone is welcome at the Print & Pizza evening hosted at Pixelbar in Rotterdam.  

Take your prints or even printer with you to show it to others, to ask questions or get help with problems. Together with the whole group you get tips, maybe someone can help you solve the problem and you get to know others with the same interest.

And of course there will be pizza. You pay for the pizza by Tikkie.

**Location**  
3D Print and Pizza Rotterdam is hosted at Hackerspace Pixelbar. We are at Schiemond 20, 3024 EE Rotterdam. This is inside "De Kroon", follow the signs for K14.

If you're coming with public transportation: you can go to Tram stop Schiemond or Metro Station Delfshaven and then walk towards the harbor.

To access the space you need to go up a set stairs, we sadly don‚Äôt have an elevator.

If you are bringing a large object we have a seperate entrance, ping one of the Pixelbar members.
